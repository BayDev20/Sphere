# WebGL Subdivided Sphere Viewer

This project is an interactive WebGL-based viewer for a subdivided sphere. The sphere is generated by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron, creating a smooth and rounded 3D shape. Users can rotate the sphere, zoom in and out, and change its colors dynamically.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Sphere**: Rotate the sphere using your mouse by clicking and dragging.
- **Zoom Control**: Use the slider to zoom in and out of the sphere.
- **Color Customization**: Change the colors of the sphere's triangles and edges with a click of a button.

## How It Works

### Sphere Creation

The sphere is created by:
1. **Base Shape**: Starting with a simple tetrahedron.
2. **Subdivision**: Recursively subdividing each triangular face. The more subdivisions, the smoother and rounder the shape becomes.
3. **Projection**: Normalizing the vertices of the subdivided triangles projects them onto the surface of a sphere.

### Interactivity

- **Rotation**: Click and drag with the mouse to rotate the sphere in 3D space.
- **Zooming**: Adjust the zoom level using the slider below the canvas.
- **Color Changing**: Click the "Change Colors" button to randomize the colors of the sphereâ€™s triangles and edges.

## Project Structure

- **HTML**: The structure of the webpage is defined in `index.html`.
- **CSS**: Basic styling is applied directly within the HTML file to create a card layout.
- **JavaScript**: The core functionality, including WebGL setup, shaders, and interaction handling, is implemented in `app.js`.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/webgl-sphere-viewer.git
   ```

2. **Open the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd webgl-sphere-viewer
   ```

3. Run on a local server 

## Technologies Used

- **WebGL**: For rendering the interactive 3D sphere.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For handling user interactions and WebGL operations.

## How to Use

- **Rotate**: Click and drag on the sphere to rotate it in different directions.
- **Zoom**: Use the slider to zoom in and out.
- **Change Colors**: Click the "Change Colors" button to apply random colors to the sphere's triangles and edges.
